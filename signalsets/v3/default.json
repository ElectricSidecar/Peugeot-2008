If engine load is limited for powertrain protection e.g. engine/turbocharger protection, this value may not reach 100%. For hybrid vehicles, indicates the torque produced only by the internal combustion engine, not the torque being delivered by the entire powertrain. For electric vehicles, the meaning of this parameter is undefined."}
